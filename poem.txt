lightning flash across the sky
silver clouds begin to cry
our clothes are cold and soaking wet
but we don't run inside just yet
if I said I'm ready now
darling, would you show me how
to blindly run through fields, unplowed
until the thunder roars?
fire races through my spine
warm hands meet my cold waistline
let's dance together, intertwined
like flowers in a storm
